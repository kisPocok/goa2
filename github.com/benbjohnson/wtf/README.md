WTF Dial
========

This project provides a real-time API for teams to view how f-cked up they 
currently are. Each team member provides input to specify the level at which
they feel the team is currently messed up. These values range from 0% (meaning
team feels there are no WTF situations) to 100% (meaning the members feel the
team is completely f-cked).

The idea for this came from [Peter Bourgon's tweets][tweets].

This repository is being built as a collaborative learning experience so that
others can see the process of building a Go application. Features will be added
in annotated pull requests and with an accompanying blog post.
